Working in small groups, students will conduct both literature and experimental research on their chosen topic to evaluate its scientific claims and the public perception to them, under the instructor's supervision. Towards the end of the course, students will write up their findings into a scientific report for professional audience and construct a piece of science communication for laymen audience.

Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment.",

The basic framework will be the \"IS-LM\" equilibrium method, in which we analyze the major markets which affect the macroeconomy - labor, output, money and foreign exchange markets by studying positions of general equilibrium in them. This framework will be used to analyze fiscal and monetary policies.  This is a core course for MBA.",

Our society is on the verge of a new era of technology convergence: robotic devices are envisioned to become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day‐to‐day lives. New technologies such as wireless communication and voice and visual recognition will make robots become behaviour‐based, cognitive and biologically-inspired humanoids. Fundamental social, economic, and technological issues of a human‐machine society will be identified and discussed in interactive sessions. The learning process is designed to transcend conventional boundaries between technology and other disciplines, and will be facilitated by a series of demonstrative sessions presenting students with opportunities to observe, evaluate, examine, and interact with a variety of commercial robots and humanoids. Guided by internal and external experts, students will focus on a specific social, business or technology issue, identifying and exploring potential solutions enabled by robotic and automation technology. In this exploration process, students will be encouraged to apply their personal background and interests, and possibly experiment with robot kits.",

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

The design thinking process modules: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test, will be introduced and the students will learn experientially by applying these process modules to solve the health unmet needs they observe in real life. The students are required to report their progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, they will showcase their prototype in a roadshow and submit their project report and reflection on their design journey. It is a common core course for students from different schools who have no background in design thinking or are looking for practical experience in design thinking.",

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

We then explore several conceptual tools and skills that can help us overcome these mistakes like systems thinking, future thinking, strategic thinking, values thinking, and complex problem solving. We then test out these mental tools by working together to develop a range of potential solutions to some of Hong Kong’s most difficult sustainability challenges.

These concepts and mechanisms are exemplified in the Circular Economy (CE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which constitute increasingly important elements in sustainable development. By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the classes cover the fundamentals of sustainable concepts, benchmarks on how to measure sustainable performance in the economic domain (i.e., at the corporate-, meso- and system-level) and empirical cases on how green finance has and can make a difference to promote sustainable growth.",

    "courseDescription": "The integration of environmental and social practices is crucial to address environmental crises, including climate change, pollution, resource scarcity and social wellbeing. Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts.",

This course will discuss the market terminology, practices, usages and dollar impact of ESG factors. The main focus is on the identification, measurement and the materiality of ESG indicators. The students will learn that financial analysis with ESG integration provides the basis for a more informed investment decision. Discussion on existing academic papers will shed light on the cost and benefits of sustainable investing.

The first topic starts with various sampling methods for generating random variables, like the basic inverse transform method and acceptance-rejection method. Special emphasis is placed on simulation of normal distributions. Next, we consider pricing financial derivatives via simulation. The dynamic price processes include the Geometric Brownian motion and jump diffusion models. Various variance reduction techniques, like the antithetic variate, control variate, conditioning and stratified sampling are considered. The solution of the optimal stopping model of an American option via the Longstaff-Schwartz regression method is discussed. We also consider rare event simulation via various importance sampling methods, like the mean drift method and cross entropy method. Applications in risk measures calculation in credit risk models, like the Gaussian copula models, are considered.",

While inheriting the traditional model of Chinese Painting, new presentation styles and contents reflecting ordinary lives and society in that period were also explored and created in numerous paintings in response to the dramatic social and political change since the turn of the 20th century. This course focuses on introducing students to the painting styles of a few Chinese painters of the past century, teaching them to appreciate the artists’ artistic perceptions and social roles embodied in their works. Through copying and imitating their styles, students will have hands-on practice of the painting principles and skills of Chinese Painting.\r\n傳統中國繪畫透過師徒傳承學習，畫家視繪畫為表達個人志趣的媒介，繪畫作品的風格往往反映了畫家的師承，性情，品味與學養。十九世紀末以來的中國繪畫，一方面繼承了傳統繪畫學習與表現的模式，一方面因應時代的變革，開發出許多創新的技法與反映當下民生社會的題材。本課程將以近百年中國畫家為切入點，引導學生學習不同繪畫風格，並了解畫者所處時代的社會角色。透過臨摹名家畫作，讓學生研習中國繪畫之畫理與技法等特點。",

Painters in every dynasty and epoch, whether official imperial court painters or literati painters in their cultural circles, have made brilliant achievements in this field. They may have different focuses, techniques and presentation methods of nature; nevertheless, what they always show is the inner scenery of the painter, the ideal world constructed by the painter. Students will learn basic brush techniques, through which they will understand the creative process of Chinese painting with the focus on landscape painting. They will be encouraged to create their own works through the application of the techniques and attempts to reform this traditional art form. \n中國繪畫以山水、花鳥、人物為三大主要分科。山水畫發展歷史悠久，經歷不同朝代及社會民生的變化，包含著複雜卻又千絲萬縷的關係。無論宮廷畫院，文人派系，甚至新中國時期以祖國建設為題的山水作品，都是以傳統基礎為依，堅守外師造化，卻不失時代環境的獨特個性。透過學習山水畫，通過臨摹、作品觀摩、範本挑選、課堂示範和練習等，同學不但能學習相關技法，也能對中國藝術的審美能力有所提升。",

Each week revolves around a special topic and a film about Chinese women located in a specific socio-historical period. This course is in chronological order, beginning from Republican women to contemporary female immigrants in the age of globalization. The changing images of women on screen went hand in hand with major cinematic movements in history, including the left turn in the 1930s, the rise of animation, socialist filmmaking, model opera film, underground/independent filmmaking, and the cinematic globalization. The purpose of this course is to build a foundation for students from different academic backgrounds who may have little or no knowledge of Chinese culture and history. Proficiency in Chinese is a plus but not required because all reading materials and class discussion are in English.",

This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea.",

    "courseDescription": "The “culture” of a community encompasses the social and personal behaviour, language and dialects, visual and performing arts, economic activities and the ideas, beliefs, and customs of its people. As a traditional genre of performing arts unique to Hong Kong, Cantonese opera has a long history of development and is entwined to arguably all such aspects of Hong Kong culture. Set within the socio‐cultural context of Hong Kong, this course explores the genre in terms of its course of development, repertory, plots, script structure, performing techniques such as singing, acting, reciting and fencing, troupe organisation, training of artists, performing venues including theatre and the bamboo stage, and its marketing strategies, aiming at unfolding to the students how an art form is appreciated through both the aesthetical and functional perspectives. The course will be offered either in Cantonese or English subject to different offerings. Students are advised to check the medium of instruction/materials before class enrollment.",

Indeed, anime has gradually emerged as a new field of research, dominating film histories and theories in the academia. This course offers an overview of anime by examining its histories, techniques and technologies, medium, genres, and conceptual issues. It will track anime’s early years, development, industrialization, globalization, and explosive boom in the digital age. Focusing on cinema features and TV series, this course will explore a variety of overlapping (sub)genres, such as Robot, Mecha, Cyberpunk, Apocalypse, Adventure, Supernatural, Shōjo, and Tragedy. Conceptual issues like cuteness, gender, sexuality, race, nation, environment, human-machine interaction, AI and posthumanism will be examined closely. Japanese language and knowledge are welcome but not required for this course.",

Are there perennial themes that thread through Chinese civilization? Is this a valid question? In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation.",

Popular accounts of global history depict human society evolving stepwise in a unilinear fashion: egalitarian hunter-gatherers gave way to hierarchical agricultural societies before the rise of cities and, later, the establishment of states. New archaeological and anthropological discoveries are now challenging such picture: the trajectory of human history, it turns out, has been much more diverse and unpredictable than previously imagined. The course will delve into anthropological phenomena that showcase this diversity, such as hunter-gatherers’ seasonality, ‘play agriculture’ in Amazonia, egalitarian cities, urban revolutions in Mesoamerica, or stranger-kings across the Pacific. These case studies, analyzed through modern anthropological theory, reveal the profound role of collective intentionality in shaping our history. They cast light on the past while also providing insights into the possibilities of the future.",

We will read classical and contemporary theories of the self, personal identity, afterlife, death, and will explore the relation between the self and its environment, the basis of (non)egoistic future concerns and responsibilities.

This is a world which is a product of mobility of people, information and products across physical and virtual boundaries. Languages themselves are changed through migration. Within a context of linguistic diversity, language is central to the organization of institutions, access to information, the exchange of goods and the ability to communicate. Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts. Key questions are: What languages and forms of communication get used, when, why and where? What linguistic factors enable and limit access for migrants to services and resources? What are the consequences?",

In the context of this course, \"technologies\" should be understood as the operations and cooperation of politics, ethics, and religions through which passions for the self and other is formed and expressed. Together, the class investigate the literary transformations and ramifications of two perennial themes - love and the self - in Chinese literature across temporal and generic boundaries. How is \"selfhood\" philosophized, lyricized, and narrated? How is \"love\" represented, assessed, and contested? We examine how one's understanding of subjectivity, imagination of gender and sexuality, and knowledge of historical changes are mediated through diverse \"technologies\" in which explorations of the self and articulations of romantic engagement intertwine.",

Distanced from the state-controlled film industry and often regarded as a counter culture against mainstream ideologies, independent cinema is frequently banned in China and screened abroad at international film festivals. As a symbol of both media democracy and secrecy, it provides us with a unique window to understand the diversified culture and society full of clamorous voices in post-1989 China. This course explores the histories, aesthetics, styles, contents, techniques, and technologies of independent cinema in contemporary China. It will be students-oriented and conducted through forms of seminars and discussions. Unlike traditional courses that are based on uni-directional lectures, readings, exams, and papers in a fixed classroom, this experimental course encourages students to venture outside and engage more with our society. It is a non-conventional, open, and democratic course that puts students in direct contact with our rapidly changing world.",

It will also discuss conceptual issues regarding national identity, ethnicity, gender, children, machines, and animals against the backdrop of an authoritarian regime. Following a chronological order, the course will begin with the socialist transition in 1949, and then move to the Seventeen Years (1949-1966) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).",

Arrested by the Mossad in Argentina in 1960, brought to Israel for trial, and ultimately sentenced to death, Eichmann’s name has become a byword for evil. This course examines how philosophers, historians, and film makers have used Eichmann’s case to try to understand totalitarianism and the nature of moral choice in modern times.",

    "courseDescription": "This course explores new ways of understanding the history of Southwest China and mainland Southeast Asia (SEA), 8th–19th centuries. In the past, Southwest China, particularly Yunnan, has been conceptualised as an area both remote from the Chinese political centre and isolated from the outside world, but an analysis of historical data concerning the formation of kingdoms and polities, trade routes, and the movement of people offers a different interpretation. It demonstrates that far from being isolated, the two areas overlap, and in reality are bonded by political, cultural and ethnic ties. Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet. Emphasis on interconnection highlights a fundamental relationship between both regions, and offers students a framework for understanding the increased presence of China in mainland SEA in recent years.",

Contracts and documents concern multi-ethnic areas in Southwest China, and students must possess the ability to read them in the original. Discussions will include not only deep reading of contracts, textual and historical analysis, but also their role as instruments of social control. This course is designed to guide students in creatively using contracts as sources for social history and is not a mere factual and descriptive account of Chinese contracts.",

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

The course's aim is to broaden the professional and engineering interests of students by enhancing their practicum/team-based experience through initiatives different from those of traditional lectures and tutorials. The training is project-based to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project.",

The topics discussed are closely related to world-wide current events that affect transnational law and dispute resolution. The lectures examine how domestic laws, and regional and international agreements impact the operations of corporations in different economic sectors (i.e. energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals etc,) and in labour relations. The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",

Using films to illustrate the correct (or wrong) concepts of physics is a good way to help the students to comprehend and apply the basic principles of science in an enjoyable way. Movies and films also frequently describes, sometimes in a grossly exaggerated manner, the dire consequences when science or technology falls in the hands of the bad people or when good science is applied for a wrong purpose by unsuspecting people who have good intentions. Analyzing such situations can help students to evaluate the social and philosophical implications of scientific discoveries and technological development.

An accurate daily weather forecast in the modern era relies not only on our intellectual understanding of the atmosphere, but also on the real-time monitoring and numerical modelling of atmospheric motions. Both of them are fruitful applications of atmospheric physics. In recent decades, there has been growing concern over human impacts on global climate. The wide-ranging claims of human-induced climate change have to be supported by scientific theories and evidence. Atmosphere physics plays a central role in such debates as the atmosphere is a core component of the climate system. This course offers both conceptual and quantitative discussions of the fundamental physical processes that shape our weather and climate.",

At the same time, the Singapore state is far more intrusive and paternalistic in certain policy domains, e.g. public housing, retirement financing, economic planning, and public sector ownership of businesses. These similarities and contrasts between Singapore and Hong Kong reveal both cities’ governing philosophies and provide insights into how history and context shape policy and outcomes.

    "courseDescription": "Light traveling in the 3D world interacts with the scene through intricate processes before being captured by a camera. These processes result in the dazzling effects like color and shading, complex surface and material appearance, different weathering, just to name a few. Physics based vision aims to invert the processes to recover the scene properties, such as shape, reflectance, light distribution, medium properties, etc., from the images by modelling and analyzing the imaging process to extract desired features or information. This course introduces the advanced methodologies in the context of physical-based vision for robotics and autonomous systems. We will introduce diverse techniques, covering from traditional methods based on hand-crafted features to recent deep learning methods. Apart from the fundamental knowledge in physical-based vision, the students will also have opportunities to discover and learn cutting-edge methodologies in popular physical-based vision topics (i.e., bad-weather restoration, shadow detection and removal, specular highlight detection and removal, intrinsic image decomposition, reflection detection and removal, and so on) of the physical-based vision, aligning with the substantial developments in robotics, autonomous driving, UAVs, etc.",

    "courseDescription": "This course is offered under the program of the HKUST Summer Institute for Secondary School Students by the School of Humanities and Social Science. Most jobs that exist today might disappear within decades. As artificial intelligence outperforms humans in increasingly more tasks, it will replace these people in the workplace. New professions will likely require more creativity and flexibility, making it difficult for economically displaced people to secure work. Consequently, by 2050 a new class of people might emerge - those who are not just unemployed, but unemployable. In this course, students will examine the history of technology and discuss ways in which technology is poised to rule over humans. This course seeks to develop students' ability to evaluate technology critically and understand the ways in which humans intervene in the design, manufacture, usage, repair and implementation of technology. Ultimately, this course aims to arm students with the analytical tools from the social sciences necessary to judge whether or not, and why, technology will rule us all.",

Understanding population change contributes to our understanding of society. At various different levels, directly or indirectly, many secondary school subjects link to population studies. In Liberal Studies, we think of public health and the reduction of mortality as well as understanding Hong Kong society through its unique demographic characteristics. In PSHE, we consider the movement of people in geography; the role of population ageing in economics; and the number of people who subscribe to different religions in sociology and anthropology. At university, population studies forms a central part of understanding many different courses of study; not only in the social sciences such as sociology, geography, economics, but also in biology, medicine, business, public health and engineering. In this course, we aim to provide a more systematic understanding of population studies.",

The key concepts for the students to grasp include diminishing returns, market economy, global trade, as well as regional division of labor, and causes of industrial revolution. This historical background is important to view the socio-economic characteristics of the pre-1949 Chinese society and their relevance to modern economic growth. This course also exposes the students to the basic concepts and analytic tools in political economy such as market economy, the state, conflict of interests, correlation and causality, and selection bias. This illustrates the importance of causal explanations in social scientific inquiry.",

It has lifted millions of people out of poverty, provided homes and communities, and become a node in a global network of megacity regions responsible for much of the world’s economic dynamism. Yet, aspirations are higher. Government, businesses, and others want to harness the region’s synergies to compete with other highly developed bay areas. Becoming an innovative high quality living region is the goal. To understand the region’s successes and challenges, the course examines the GBA’s evolution through the agglomeration processes of external economies, governance and urbanization. These processes led the GBA’s development and will determine its future - in terms of continued economic development and more importantly in terms of the wellbeing of the GBA’s people.",

Japan’s success has been attributed to its whole-hearted efforts of “learning from the west”. In the meantime, Japan’s colonial expansion after 1895 and particularly after 1905 has also been characterized as “learning from the west”, in this case, imperialism. Japan did establish a constitutional monarchy in 1891. In 1925, it became the first country in East Asia to achieve universal male suffrage, a crucial measure of democracy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. How did Japan build a system of imperial democracy before 1930? Why did democracy not consolidate in Japan but instead be replaced by military fascism after 1937? This course will resolve this puzzle by examining Japan’s history of economic and political development.",

Movies illustrate human lives and feelings in a dramatic way, which often allows us to experience historical events or lives in the other side of the world indirectly. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the field of political science and key events in political history by watching movies describing them. Often political concepts such as state, democracy, dictatorship, repression and protest, representation, and election, are considered too abstract or too complicated. Addressing those concepts through movies will allow students to understand those concepts with living examples and empathy. The course explores important political topics and themes including political power and election, democracy, protest and repression, media, corruption, and war. By watching movies, attending lectures, and participating in discussions, students not only learn these concepts but also understand that political issues are part of our society and history and have a substantial influence on individual's life.",

This is an age in which we tend to explain human behavior in terms of our individual achievements, personalities, and even our genetic make-up. The sociologist, however, looks at human behavior as the product of groups, organizations and culture. In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics.",

The focus will be on the specification of models including choice of control variables, the interpretation of results, handling missing data, and the challenges posed by reverse causality, omitted variable bias, endogeneity, and other issues that commonly arise in the analysis of social data. The second part introduces analytical strategies for “unconventional” data types, such as social network, web data, and plain texts. Special attention will be given to challenges to social scientists regarding data extraction, data integration, and visualization.",

It will seek to understand how meanings are produced, mediated, negotiated, subverted, and celebrated in popular music. Through discussions based on a combination of selected readings, films/videos, and music recordings, students will not only get acquainted with popular music well beyond their own or what they normally listen to; they will also gain alternative perspectives on what constitutes \"popular music\" in different East Asian contexts and their significance.",
